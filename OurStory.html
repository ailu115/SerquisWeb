                <h3>Design Philosophy</h3>
                <p>
                    Successful designs should engage the environment, have fluency among
                    history, land forms and architecture, express rhythm with textures
                    and interest among the seasons. We believe there is a close
                    connection between balancing human needs and preserving what nature
                    has given us to enjoy, and that beautiful surroundings nourish the
                    human spirit. We are passionate about communities, whether they be
                    rural or urban settings. We truly understand the social impact where
                    clear landscape design helps connection between community and
                    peoples, where they relate to and learn from the natural and built
                    environment. We create multi-disciplinary teams, including the
                    client, catering to each and every project to form think tanks that
                    inspire ideas that are most appropriate to the site and users.

                <h3>Solange Serquis</h3>
                <h4>Landscape Architect, Firm Owner, and Lead Designer</h4>
                <p>
                    Solange studied at the University of Buenos Aires completing a
                    program inclusive of architecture, agricultural science and
                    landscape architecture, with a final thesis in “Healing Gardens”.
                    Solange will provide landscape architecture services as the primary
                    local landscape architect. Solange’s design background focuses on
                    integrating process-design with the ecological concepts and
                    educational opportunities for master planning and landscape design.
                    <br />
                    She has worked in both private, public and non-profit organization
                    design environments on community, educational, and agricultural
                    projects. Solange is the principal of Serquis + Associates as well
                    as a very active participant in the community. With Spanish as her
                    first language and English her second, Solange works passionately
                    assisting numerous social-kids-educational-friendly events where she
                    merges her knowledge and activism for educational landscapes and the
                    relationship between indoor-outdoor spaces with her desire to help
                    the young.

                        the difficult New Mexico terrain. It not only takes a trained eye from a design & aesthetics
                        perspective, but also the experience and knowledge of the local environment in which to plan for
                        the long term, consistently delivering a successful result. Each project is uniquely designed to
                        the specifications of both the owners and the elements of their home. Solange and her team are
                        incredibly professional and creative in each & every execution, which is why we consider them
                        one of our valued preferred partners. They are a pleasure to work with, regardless of project
                        scale or size.

                        Our home was a new build and our backyard was a blank slate of dirt and weeds. Solange made it
                        her top priority to understand our taste and how we hoped to utilize the space. She then created
                        a design that exceeded anything I could imagine. We had Solange and her team oversee the
                        installation as well. She was frequently onsite making sure every detail was right. I could not
                        be happier with the work Serquis + Associates did.

                    difficult New Mexico terrain. It not only takes a trained eye from a design & aesthetics
                    perspective, but also the experience and knowledge of the local environment in which to plan for the
                    long term, consistently delivering a successful result. Each project is uniquely designed to the
                    specifications of both the owners and the elements of their home. Solange and her team are
                    incredibly professional and creative in each & every execution, which is why we consider them one of
                    our valued preferred partners. They are a pleasure to work with, regardless of project scale or
                    size.
